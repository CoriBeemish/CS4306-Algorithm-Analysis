## Quick Sort
An efficient sorting algorithm
**Best-case performance:** O(n log n)
**Worse-case performance:** O(n^2)
**Average:** O(n log n)

**Steps**
1. Select a pivot element from the array.
2. Reorder the array so that the elements smaller than the pivot are to its left and elements larger are to its right.
3. Repeat from step 1 to each sub-array of smaller values and then seperately to the sub-array of larger values.
